# Description of the project
The company Trackgenix provides development services other companies. They have requested us to develop a web system called Trackgenix, which will make it easier for uploading the working hours of each employee, project and work teams. 
This system includes a Landing page divided in a series of sections:

- WHAT IS TRACKGENIX
- FEATURES
- WHY TRACKGENIX
- CONTACT US
- TRACKGENIX

It also includes a header, a footer and a sidebar 

## *Content*
In this repository you will find five folders labeled under the name Week-0X, the X changing according to what week of work they were created. Each one has a number of folders and files that were used to accomplish that week problematic.

## *Progress*
**Week 1:** It was created in Figma a prototype of how it would look the structure and the layout of the project requested.\

**Week 2:** It was created an "index" file where the landing page would be arranged. Up to this point the "index" file has only been worked on by using HTML language to be displayed in a web browser but is expected to be assisted by other techonologies and script languages. \

**Week 3:** The "index" file created the previous week has been styled by using CSS to resemble the landing page requested by the company. \

**Week 4:** It was designed a responsive layout using the concept Mobile First, making it functional to other screen sizes such as tablets and desktops devices. \
\
**Week 5:** It was created a new folder which contains an index.html file and an exercises file. Within the exercises one there are six Javascript files labeled under names that express what  they are about. Each JS file has a series of exercises that deal with different Javascript variables. \

**Week 6:** It was created a new folder in which were duplicated the files located in the one from Week 04. There were added six new files to create two new screens. It was added style with CSS and given function to the forms found in each screen using Javascript.\
