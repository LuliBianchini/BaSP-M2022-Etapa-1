# Description of the project
The company Trackgenix provides development services  other companies. They have requested us to develop a web system called Trackgenix, which will make it easier for uploading the working hours of each employee, project and work teams. 
This system includes a Landing page divided in a series of sections:

- WHAT IS TRACKGENIX
- FEATURES
- WHY TRACKGENIX
- CONTACT US
- TRACKGENIX

It also includes a header, a footer and a sidebar 

## Content
In this repository you will find an HTML  file named "index" which contains the landing of a webpage and a folder labeled "Assets" where all the image files are stored.

## Progress
Up to this point the "index" file has only been worked on by using HTML language to be displayed in a web browser but is expected to be assisted by other techonologies and script languages.
